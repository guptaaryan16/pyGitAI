PyGitNotes
------------

This CLI package wants effective utilization of git commit text bodies for correct contexts of the changes generated by the developers.

Here we want to parse the `git diff` on your current branch to the LLMs like ChatGPT or a local LLM model to generate a smart changelog that can help developers to make effective decisions and understand the changes.

This will be very helpful for small project developers who can rely on this tool to generate smart commit and body-text messages and maintain good standards in the project.

The long term goal is to integrate this tool with ghstack, Graphite, and other git based CLI tools. Also we want to increase the `ease of use` of AI in the development space.

Thanks for using this tool. This is my first Python package so please support me, and forgive me for any poor design choices.


Project Methodology
-------------------

The project follows a "Developer first" approach with the maximum effort towards the effective integration of industry standard tools like graphite and LLMs that come in the market. My focus is also to make sure you have a positive  developer experience using this tool on your local projects and this doesn't hamper your ability to work on your git projects in any way.

The use of tools like GitPython which were developed as hobby projects like this have provided me a great reason to follow all standard practices in Python for the development of this project. The idea is not reinventing the wheel but to make it more usable wherever possible. I saw the project `AICommits` and did not like the use of NodeJS env which makes the project less maintainable and in general leads to fewer choices available to the developers in the future. So this is my alternative, which you may or may not like, but again in general both is fine by me.

Also as a remark, I believe Python envs are usually more suitable for CLI applications especially those that uses AI and Data Science in general as the developer experience of Python scripting is easier for most developers to adapt to.
